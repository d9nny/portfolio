    "description": "Hard working and eager to improve my skills and learn new tech. I can be trusted to work autonomously, having previously been a manager, and love working in a team. Analytical, a natural problem solver with a Maths Degree. An out of the box thinker with an entrepreneurial mindset, my imagination is a strong influence in almost everything I do. Passionate about code, because it's given me the ability to create, my perfect mix! I'm looking for a junior dev role with a focus on TDD/BDD, software craftsmanship and continued development and innovation."
